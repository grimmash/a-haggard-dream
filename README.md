# A Haggard Dream
A short adventure for introducing a coven of hags to your 5e game.

Adapted from my one-shot on DM's Guild [Sewing up a Dream](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/359199/Sewing-up-a-Dream?affiliate_id=18983).  This versino uses only SRD content and removes direct references to the source campaign.  However it should be very easy to adapt it if you want to use the original version.

# Instructions
Install via Foundry.  All content is in the compendiums:
- Scenes: One dream lair scene, walled, lit and with some explanations on use in the Journals.  WEBP and JPG available.
- Actors: SRD monsters in the compendium and placed on the map.
- Items: A few bespoke items.
- Rolltables: For use in one of the rooms, if you want.
- Journals: Intro, setup, and journals for each room, placed on the map as pins as well.

Enjoy!
