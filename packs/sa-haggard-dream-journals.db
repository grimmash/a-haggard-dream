one of the metals matching the locks and keys.  The crucibles are hanging from chains that fade up into the darkness.  Each pot is positioned to pour into a large mold at the head of each of the five tables.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You begin to feel a lethargy and drowsiness overcome you.  As you struggle to stay conscious, you hear footsteps enter the room.  Three figures walk up and gentle guide each of you to one of the tables.  All three are vaguely humanoid.  The first is wearing tattered robes.  Her eyes have cold coins covering the entire socket, and ants crawl out of the robes and swarm around her head.  The second walks with a thump from her peg leg.  Stringers of teeth hanging from her clothing clatter as she moves, and she chuckles softly, yellow gas escaping from her smiling mouth with each breath.  The final figure has a squirming leather bag over her head.  You can see scales, feathers and fur poking out from the bottom edges of the bag.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As your eyesight dims, they lay you each down on a table and gently secure you in the restraints.  A calm feeling washes over you as your heads are placed gently into the molds beneath the cauldrons, each shaped as different, intricate helmet with geometric sides.  As the hags step back to work the chains that turn the cauldrons, you sight goes bright and then dark.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You awaken in your

For years they have passed the time torturing the local denizens of and stray outsiders that have ventured too close to their lair.  When a new party, a stronger party, arrives the coven begin to plan a truly special introduction for themselves.  They also plan a hideous surprise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The introduction is a nightmare, replete with monsters, puzzles and a final foreboding climax.  The surprise is that all dreams have a kernel of truth, and the coven want to trick the party into giving them a small piece of themselves to animate, distort, and thrown back in the faces of these new guests.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hags have crafted a dreamscape where each dreamer finds and enters a door to a pocket dimension controlled by the coven.  Once there, the dreamers encounter aspects of the hags, solve their riddles, and finally return the prizes they win along the way at the end of the dream.  While the dreamers are in the realm of the coven, the hags gather what they need to make twisted homunculi of each dreamer.  These homunculi can be used for a variety of nefarious purposes after the dream is over and the dreams return to the waking world.  The dreamers are only vaguely aware that they have been manipulated.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n<h2>Memories as Dreams</h2>\n</div>\n<p>As the adventuring party lays down for sleep, each member drifts into a dreamlike expanse founded on a memory of a place of importance important from their past.  Ask the players to take turns describing their place, why it is important, and what the key features are.  This is a good chance to allow players to really share or develop some story for their character, so try to let each have as much time as is reasonable to savor the spotlight of telling their story.  If a player is highly resistant or does not want to, you may want to have a short description prepared so that you can keep the flow of the dream-stories moving.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Once each dream-memory has reached a conclusion, narrate to the player that in a conspicuous place in their memory, there is a stone doorway arch.  As the character inspects the arch, they can see a dark, formless place beyond.  The character is drawn towards the arch as one is in dreams: it makes no sense, but there an irresistible itch or urge that is hard to resist.  If a character is reluctant to go through, confirm that this seems to be a dream, and describe the rest of the dream as slowly fading away and focusing down to the one point.  Eventually the character will go through the arch, if for no other reason than the dream world of their memory is collapsing.  If you have more mature players or are comfortable with the approach, feel free to start corrupting and twisting their memory.  The twisting and corruption should drive the character to, and through the archway.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"MUZbrUYvN0jBRnef":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.XnrJ70MvovVnOtZj"}}}
